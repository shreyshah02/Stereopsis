# Based on the depth, the three-dimensional mesh was created, and then paint one of the original color images onto it.
# To achieve this task, the RGB values from the color image was converted to a DataFrame. The depth map, opened as
# grayscale, was converted into an array of depths and was also added to the Dataframe. The DataFrame was converted to
# point cloud using PyntCloud library. The corresponding point cloud was then converted to a .ply file and the point
# cloud was then displayed using the software â€“ MeshLab.
#Get the colour image. Convert the RGB values to a DataFrame:

colourImg= Image.open("Desk_L.JPG")
colourPixels = colourImg.convert("RGB")
#Add the RGB values to the DataFrame with a little help from StackOverflow.

colourArray  = np.array(colourPixels.getdata()).reshape((colourImg.height, colourImg.width) + (3,))
indicesArray = np.moveaxis(np.indices((colourImg.height, colourImg.width)), 0, 2)
imageArray   = np.dstack((indicesArray, colourArray)).reshape((-1,5))
df = pd.DataFrame(imageArray, columns=["x", "y", "red","green","blue"])

#Open the depth-map as a greyscale image. Convert it into an array of depths. Add it to the DataFrame

depthImg = Image.open('Depth.png').convert('L')
depthArray = np.array(depthImg.getdata())
df.insert(loc=2, column='z', value=depthArray)
#Convert it to a Point Cloud and display it:

df[['x','y','z']] = df[['x','y','z']].astype(float)
df[['red','green','blue']] = df[['red','green','blue']].astype(np.uint)
cloud = PyntCloud(df)
# Save the point cloud as .ply file to display it in meshlab.
